        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m JP—an avid traveler passionate about discovering new places and meeting people. I love technology and the art of filmmaking. I thought that by creating this website, I would be able to showcase my work and connect with those interested in working with me.

            Over the past year, I’ve been making  social media content for local businesses.

            I am always looking for new places and people to work with. Let’s work together to make sure your brand is told the way it deserves to be.</p>
